What is involved in this website:
-HTML, CSS (absolutely)
-AJAX (definitely)
-Bootstrap 4.0 (we were lazy)
-Google Charts (we did not specify version to make sure it will always be the newest.
                but if something goes wrong with charts, it is because Google has updated
                a new version that did not work with our parameters, good luck fixing).
